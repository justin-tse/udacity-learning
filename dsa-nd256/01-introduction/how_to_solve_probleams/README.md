# How to solve a problem
- Do not panic!
- 1.What are the inputs?
- 2.What are the outputs?
- 3.Work through some examples by hand
- 4.Simple mechanical solution
- 5.Develop incrementally and test as we go
  
Don't optimize prematurely! Simple and Correct

- Solve a problem 
  => Understand the Inputs
  => Understand the Outputs
  => Understand the Relationship - some examples
  => Consider systematically how a human solves the problem
  Algorithm Pseudocode => We should try to find a simple way first!
